          <p>Kirby Deater-Deckard is part of several international teams that are studying the interaction between biological factors and family/peer social environments in cognitive and social-emotional development in childhood and adolescence. The US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.bsf.org.il/BSFPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">www.bsf.org.il</a>) has just awarded a grant to Dr. Naama Atzaba-Poria of Ben-Gurion University in Israel and Deater-Deckard, to study parenting and sibling relationships following low- and high-risk births of a second child. </p><p>Deater-Deckard also recently received funding from the Shandong provincial government in Jinan, China, to study gene-environment interaction effects on development using data from the Longitudinal Study of Chinese Children and Adolescents in Jinan. Dr. Guanghui Chen, a colleague from Shandong Normal University in Jinan, is visiting in July and will present on their collaborative work on children’s bullying victimization and cortisol reactivity/recovery.</p><p>In addition, Deater-Deckard is consultant and mentor on a team in the Finn Brain Birth Cohort Study. He is working with Elisabeth Nordenswan, a doctoral psychology student in Turku, Finland. Nordenswan recently received dissertation fellowship funding from three research foundations in Finland, to examine behavioral and physiological indicators of executive function in mothers and their young children. </p>

          <h2>Maureen Perry-Jenkins receives the UMass Life Science Moment Fund Award</h2>
          <img src="images/maureen_perry-jenkins.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right leftPadding" alt="mpj">
          <p>Maureen Perry-Jenkins, PhD, Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Director of Center for Research on Families, UMass Amherst and Nancy Byatt, DO, MS, MBA, Associate Professor, Dept. of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology, UMass Medical School have been awarded the UMass Life Science Moment Fund Award! This fund supports inter-campus projects based in clinical and translational research. Projects are envisioned to produce meaningful health outcomes while strengthening faculty-to-faculty networks within the University.</p>
<p>The goal of the researchers’ community-based study is to adapt and test the feasibility of a group-based intervention aimed at reducing depression and stress (both perceived and physiological stress) among low-income new mothers and their partners early in pregnancy. Currently, there is great disparity between the rates of perinatal depression among low-income and middle-class mothers, with low-income mothers experiencing poorer mental health.  One reason for this disparity is due to more parenting stressors, which may be affecting their mothers' and fathers' mental health and the healthy development of their child. </p>
<p>Perry-Jenkins and Byatt will partner with Square One and the Children’s Trust, who lead parent education programs in the state for low-income parents. The group-based intervention, based on evidence-based programming by Drs. Marsha Pruett and Rob Straus, will be conducted at Square One of Springfield, MA.  The intervention will adapt the Choices in Childbirth & Co-Parenting (3CP) program aimed at supporting low-income couples through the transition to parenthood. The 3CP program will be adapted to (1) address the unique needs of mothers and partners in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and (2) strengthen the focus on building the co-parenting relationship and reducing stress and depression.</p>
<p>The 6-session 3CP program will allow eight couples to learn from two Healthy Family Educators through presentations, interactive sessions and discussions between mother and their partner or support-person. After the first group intervention, the process will be repeated two more times, resulting in three intervention groups. Innovative aspects of this study include supporting new parents very early in pregnancy, and evaluating and building a sustainable structure for prenatal interventions in the Springfield community aimed at supporting vulnerable families around the birth of a child. Also, data will be collected on two different aspects of potential stress, both self-reported stress and biological indicators of stress in the hormone cortisol. Understanding dysregulation (chronic levels and diurnal rhythm of cortisol) in mothers' cortisol early in pregnancy will help to clarify intervention effects on stress reduction and perinatal depression.</p>

          <img src="images/adam_grabell.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right leftPadding" alt="mpj">
          <p>Adam Grabell, Assistant Professor, starting Fall 2017 in the UMass Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences has received an NIH K23 Award! This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will train Grabell to probe deliberate regulation in preschoolers ranging from low to severe irritability, over a period of rapid development, and connect findings to translational implications. Grabell’s current expertise includes differentiating the normal:abnormal spectrum of emergent psychopathology, with a focus on early disruptive behavior, multivariate statistics, and basic skills in acquiring and analyzing EEG and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. His mentorship team, Drs. Harvey, Perlman, Wakschlag, Huppert, Grovetant, Deater-Deckard, and Fox, will provide expertise in child neuroimaging, emotion regulation, irritability, longitudinal design, and child treatment efficacy.</p>

                  <p>Reading is an essential skill in modern society.  Developing effective methods for teaching reading, and effective interventions for reading difficulties and disabilities, requires an understanding of the cognitive processes involved in fluent reading.  Recent research has suggested that skilled reading may be aided by our ability to predict upcoming words.  Readers use their knowledge of their language and the world to anticipate or predict the words that they are likely to encounter; words that are correctly predicted are more easily recognized.  The present research investigates this phenomenon in detail, comparing data from two state-of-the-art methods: 1) tracking of readers' eye movements and 2) recording of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which reflect the brain’s activity in response to individual words. Both methods show reliable changes in response to a word's predictability.  A paradox that motivates the present research is that eye movements reflect a word's predictability only when the word can be pre-processed in peripheral vision, before it is directly inspected. In contrast, ERPs reflect a word's predictability even without such pre-processing.  By achieving a better understanding of what these two methods are telling us, and the source of the differential effects, the investigators hope to further our knowledge of the ways in which making unconscious predictions about upcoming words can benefit readers.</p>     
 
<p>The researchers test the hypothesis that predictability influences eye movements through an influence on early orthographic processing, which is carried out in parafoveal vision while a word is not viewed with maximum visual acuity.  This implies a Bayesian account of the predictability effect, whereby the influence of a contextually based prior is strong only when perceptual evidence is relatively ambiguous.  The effect of predictability in ERPs is thought to be an entirely distinct effect on late, integrative processes.  To test the predictions of these hypotheses, eight eye-movement experiments using the boundary paradigm (in which a word is replaced by a different word until it is directly fixated) will be carried out.  Three of these experiments also require participants to detect the change from preview to target explicitly, as the hypotheses make novel predictions about the circumstances in which such changes are detectable.  Two of the experiments combine eye-movement recording and the boundary paradigm with concurrent ERP measures.  In these experiments the effects of predictability on eye movements and ERPs are expected to be fully dissociable, with one or the other emerging depending on the nature of the preview word and the target word.  Finally, the E-Z Reader model of eye movements in reading will be modified to account for these effects, as well as other predictability-related phenomena.  A new, publicly available implementation of E-Z Reader will be developed, which will allow other researchers to evaluate the model's architecture and test the effects of changes to model parameters.</p>
